# **Personal Project Phase I - PERSONAL WEBSITE 🌐**

&nbsp;

## **📝Notes:**

- This is the first step of a Three Phase project, leading upto a fully developed Portfolio website.
- The idea is to keep the site minimal with rich graphic content, giving the viewer a good interactive experience.
- The Website includes features such as:
    Typewritting effect for Intro
    Spin cards
    Scrolling background, to give it a bigger flow space.
